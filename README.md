the original sample image i took had over 22500 pixel hence it took made a lot more iterations .
i resized the image using *openCV* to 100x100 pixels now its 125% faster , sure there is datalot but in such case it cant be helped 

i used this code for my project of handwash management system ( * soon whole project will be uploaded with a video on youtube *)
even there i used resize because where i had to showcase the project internet connectivity was not available hence no *google firebase *
just a raspberry pi doing all the computing . i have added flags so that if someone is willing to use the code you will understand what 
problem is that you are facing .
